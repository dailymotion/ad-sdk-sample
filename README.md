## ðŸ“˜ Public API Documentation

### `async initialize(playerContainer: HTMLElement): Promise<void>`

Loads the external ad SDK script and creates internal DOM elements for ad playback.<br />
This method should be called before any other function of the SDK and once per page.

**Parameters:**

- `playerContainer`: `HTMLElement`
  The DOM element where the ad container will be mounted.

**Throws:**
If the container is missing or the script fails to load.

---

### `loadAdsSequence(appState: AppState): void`

Loads ads sequence with the provided contextual information. <br />

After this call, the ad SDK will listen to the progress of the video and will trigger an `AD_BREAK_START` event whenever an ad break is about to begin. When this event occurs, the video player is expected to pause playback. Playback should resume only after the corresponding AD_BREAK_END event is received. <br />

A preroll ad may start automatically after this call. If no preroll is available, the SDK will send an AD_BREAK_END event to indicate that content playback can proceed.<br />

This method should be called once per video, before starting the main content.

**Parameters:**

- `appState`: `AppState`
  A structured object providing ad targeting and playback environment data.
